### 5/27

#### Agenda

1. Setup ECR
2. build a pipeline for creating Images and push it up

#### Apply

#### Code

#### Questions

##### ECR

- CountType: "SinceImagePushed" -> life of the content starts counting the day it was pushed
- another common type would be "imageCountMoreThan", which keeps the N newest image
- executionRoleArn is responsible for ecs to be able to fetch images from ecr

##### Github reusable actions

- one can define reusable actions, recommended in a private repo, and configure to allow other workflow to utilize it -> more info https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#allowing-access-to-components-in-a-private-repository
- composite action: can be used by workflows with uses: clause, needs to ran inside a job as a step
- workflows can be used by other workflows as a standalone job, but requires workflow_call under on keyword
- id in a step is useful for later reference if we need its output
- we login to ECR with Docker provided composite action because under the hood, ecr is another docker container registry, it issues a token temporarily to support the same interface
- provenance Controls whether build metadata/SBOM is included (like a receipt)
- cache-from Speeds up build by reusing cached layers from previous builds (from S3)
- cache-to Saves newly built layers to cache for reuse next time

#### Todo

1. ECS: setup a running ecs
2. how does ECS connect to db??
3. RDS (Continue)
   - Monitoring
   - Credentials in Secret Manager
   - Apply
4. ALB (New)
